2-D Java Game Engine

This is a simple bundle of all the default libraries that I use to create 2-D games in Java.
I created this sofware so that my roommates could learn to code in an environment that was fun
and handled all of the graphics, input, and other background code for them so that they could
focus on learning the basics of programming in an environment that yeilded fun projects.
